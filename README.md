# latex-macro-expander

The code for the LaTeX Macro Expander can be found in the proj1 folder, and it is fairly simple to run. Simply build the C file using the Makefile and then run the built executable with an input txt file. The code should produce the correct resulting expansion of the macros, of which some examples include:
\def{B}{Buffalo}
